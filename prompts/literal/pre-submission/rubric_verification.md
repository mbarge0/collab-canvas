**When to use**: After completing a full module or project to validate rubric alignment, ensure submission readiness, and confirm quality standards are met before final delivery or approval.  
**When not to use**: During active build or debugging work — use “Build” or “Debugging Loop” instead.

Let’s perform a **Final Rubric Verification Review** using the Rubric Verification Loop Template.  
Validate the deployed or local build against the project rubric and deliverable requirements.  
Check functionality, performance, persistence, scalability, and UX consistency.  
Ensure that all submission artifacts — including the development log, demo video, and README — meet rubric expectations.  

Generate a structured rubric verification checklist for this phase and confirm pass/fail status for each rubric category.  
Document test evidence (screenshots, logs, or notes) for each section.  
Summarize the verification results clearly — list ✅ fully compliant areas, ⚠️ partial or needs review items, and ❌ failing or missing requirements.  
Conclude with an overall submission readiness status (Ready / Needs Review / Blocked) and provide recommendations for any last-minute fixes or polish items before submission.  
Store the resulting rubric verification report under:  
`/docs/operations/phases/phase-XX-05-verification.md`
