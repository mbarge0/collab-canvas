## Phase Context
- **Phase:** 05 ‚Äî Supermodule: Pre-AI Reliability, Persistence, Auth & Advanced Features (A1‚ÄìA5)
- **Date:** 2025-10-15
- **References:**
  - Design Spec: `/docs/operations/phases/phase-05-03-design.md`
  - UI Guidelines: `/docs/foundation/ui-guidelines.md`
  - Build context: code changes across `app/c/[canvasId]/page.tsx`, `components/ui/Toolbar.tsx`, `components/layout/AuthHeader.tsx`, `app/login/page.tsx`, and canvas components

---

## Compliance Summary

- **Visual fidelity:** Strong. Layout matches spec: two-column login (hero + auth card), canvas page with header, centered bottom toolbar, page frame visuals. Colors and iconography align with neutral/blue primary palette; smart guides use purple accent as specified.
- **Accessibility:** Good baseline. Toolbar now has `role="toolbar"`; buttons have tooltips/titles. Focus rings present via shared `Button`. Needs: ensure all icon-only buttons have accessible names and that hero contrast over image remains AA.
- **Responsiveness:** Desktop layout complete; tablet condenses logically; mobile shows toolbar center with potential horizontal scroll when cramped. Login stacks on small screens per grid rules.
- **Interactivity:** Buttons responsive with hover/focus; toolbar menus rendered as single buttons (MVP). Motion is subtle (CSS transitions) and does not hinder performance.
- **Consistency:** Components use shared Button/Input styles; colors and spacing follow the 8px grid. Toolbar shape and glassy surface are consistent with spec.

## Detailed Checklist

### ‚úÖ Compliant
- Canvas page frame with light background and blue outline when focused
- Bottom-docked toolbar with rounded container, blur, and shadow
- Keyboard shortcuts: nudge, delete; toolbar actions for duplicate, align, z-index, export
- Grid overlay toggle (8px); snap-to-grid (magnet 6px)
- Smart guides (purple lines) on alignment
- Login page: two-column layout with hero and accessible form; responsive stacking
- Connection status chip in header (connected/reconnecting)

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Issues
- Icon-only toolbar buttons rely on `title` but no explicit `aria-label` bindings; some screen readers may miss context
- Export SVG is minimal and may differ slightly from Konva render (text baseline)
- Mobile: toolbar may overflow horizontally on very small heights; needs scroll/overflow handling confirmation

### üéØ Recommendations
- Add `aria-label` to each icon-only button in `Toolbar` and ensure labels match tooltip text
- Consider a compact/overflow mode for toolbar on mobile (group lesser-used actions under a menu)
- Tweak SVG text baseline to better match canvas rendering if required; acceptable for MVP
- Ensure hero image overlay keeps text contrast ‚â• 4.5:1 on all shipped assets

## Confidence Score
- **Visual compliance:** 90%
- **Readiness:** Approved for Debug Phase with minor accessibility and overflow refinements noted above.

---

## Next Steps
- Address accessibility labels for toolbar icon buttons
- Verify toolbar overflow behavior on mobile (< 360px width or < 720px height)
