# Phase 02 — Reflection (Authentication)

## 1) Phase Context
- Phase number/name/date: 02 — Authentication (MVP), Oct 13, 2025
- Duration: ~1 working block
- Objectives: Firebase Auth (Email/Password + Magic Link), auth gate for `/c/[canvasId]`, display name fallback, tests and regression checks
- Checkpoint(s): see commit created via checkpoint scripts after build/debug; build log at `docs/operations/phases/phase-02-03-build.md`, debug report at `docs/operations/phases/phase-02-debug.md`

## 2) Achievements
- Implemented `useFirebaseAuth` hook with Email/Password and Magic Link flows
- Added `/login` page with toggles for Magic Link and Email/Password
- Introduced `AuthGuard` and protected `/c/[canvasId]`
- Added `deriveDisplayName(email)` fallback utility
- Build and smoke E2E passed; unit tests passed (legacy act() warning noted)
- Removed legacy Supabase routes that broke production build

## 3) Challenges
- Legacy Supabase endpoints (`/app/auth/callback`, `/api/test-db`) caused production build failure
- React `act()` warning persisted in Supabase-based `useAuth.test.ts`
- Ensuring Magic Link completion triggers reliably in App Router

## 4) Root Cause Analysis
- Mixed stacks (Supabase remnants + new Firebase) created build-time conflicts
- Test warning due to outdated test harness around async auth state updates
- Magic Link flow requires correct action URL and localStorage email capture for completion

## 5) Process Evaluation
- Code quality: strong; hook and components follow typed, readable patterns
- Architecture alignment: consistent with PRD/architecture (Firebase Auth, App Router gating)
- Testing: unit + smoke E2E validated; dedicated auth E2E yet to be added (planned)
- Documentation: start/plan/build/debug docs created for traceability

## 6) Phase Performance Score
- Score: 90%
- Justification: All core objectives delivered and build green; one low-severity test warning outstanding; dedicated auth E2E pending

## 7) Key Learnings
- Remove or isolate legacy integrations early to avoid build-time failures
- Client-side guard is fast to implement; may later complement with middleware
- Early environment validation (env.ts debug logs) reduces config uncertainty

## 8) Actionable Improvements
- Add Playwright auth + guard E2E (login redirect, success path)
- Update/extend unit tests for `useFirebaseAuth` and resolve the `act()` warning
- Document Firebase Auth provider setup and action URL in README

## 9) Forward Outlook
- Next phase focus (Routing & Shell): flesh out `/c/[canvasId]` canvas shell and integrate layout while preserving auth guard
- Dependencies: Firebase Auth now stable; ensure guard logic works with server-side data needs (consider middleware later if needed)
- Optimization: refine loading UX during auth resolution; consider caching displayName

## 10) Reflection Summary
Phase 02 successfully established authentication with Firebase and protected the canvas route, replacing legacy Supabase pieces and restoring a clean production build. Remaining test and E2E enhancements are straightforward and will harden reliability as we move into routing and shell work.
