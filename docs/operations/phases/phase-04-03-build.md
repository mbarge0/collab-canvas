# Build Log — Module #4: Canvas Engine & UI (MVP)

## Phase Context
- **Session:** Begin Build
- **Date:** Oct 13, 2025
- **Goal:** Implement T1–T3 from the plan: dependencies, canvas store, CanvasStage with pan/zoom; scaffold selection/transforms layers.

## Build Objectives
- Add `react-konva` and `konva` dependencies.
- Create `useCanvasStore` with viewport/selection/mode and in-memory nodes.
- Implement `CanvasStage` with wheel zoom (cursor-centered) and Space+drag panning.
- Wire `ShapeLayer`, `SelectionLayer`, and `TransformHandles` for selection/marquee/transforms.
- Integrate stage in `/c/[canvasId]` via dynamic import.

## Implementation Log
1) Dependencies
- Installed: `react-konva`, `konva`.

2) Store
- Added `lib/store/canvas-store.ts` with:
  - `viewport { scale, position }`, `selectedIds`, `mode`.
  - `nodes` in-memory seed; actions for selection, viewport, node updates, nudge/delete.

3) Canvas Stage
- Added `components/canvas/CanvasStage.tsx`:
  - ResizeObserver to fit container; wheel zoom about cursor; Space+drag panning.
  - Added `tabIndex={0}` to container for focus.
  - Added base `Layer` with `ShapeLayer`, `SelectionLayer`, `TransformHandles`.

4) Route Integration
- Updated `app/c/[canvasId]/page.tsx` to render `CanvasStage` via `next/dynamic` (SSR disabled).

5) Layers & Keyboard
- `ShapeLayer.tsx`: Renders seed rectangles; click selects; Shift-click adds to selection.
- `SelectionLayer.tsx`: Full-canvas marquee with union on Shift; converts screen→world coords.
- `TransformHandles.tsx`: BBox with draggable corners for resize and rotate handle; group drag moves selection.
 - Keyboard (in `CanvasStage` container): Delete removes selected, Esc clears selection, Arrow keys nudge (Shift=10px).

## Testing Validation
- Lints: clean for all new/modified files.
- Unit: store tests for viewport/selection/nudge/delete; stage render test with react-konva mocked.
- E2E scaffold: route renders stage wrapper.
- Manual: Stage renders and resizes; wheel zoom and Space+drag panning work; marquee draws; selection outlines visible; handles render and respond.

## Bugs & Fixes
- None observed; monitor Konva SSR edge cases (handled via dynamic import, SSR off).

## Checkpoint Summary
- **Branch:** canvas
- **Checkpoint:** Phase 04 — T1–T3 complete; T4/T5 scaffolds present.
- **Stability:** Green (dev compile); ready to proceed with selection/transform refinements and keyboard.

## Next Steps
- Acceptance verified for Module 4 scope:
  - Stage renders with smooth pan/zoom; selection, marquee, transforms, keyboard working locally.
  - Unit tests pass; E2E scaffold passes (login redirect handled).
- Prepare Debug Loop:
  - Generate phase regression checklist; run smoke for Modules #1–#3.
  - Expand E2E to cover pan/zoom/selection sanity if time allows.
