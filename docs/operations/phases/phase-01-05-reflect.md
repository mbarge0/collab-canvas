# Reflection — Module #1: Environment & Tooling (MVP)

---

## 1) Phase Context
- Phase: Module #1 — Environment & Tooling (MVP)
- Date: Oct 13, 2025
- Duration: ~1 working block
- Objectives: Initialize Firebase & Sentry, scaffold unit/E2E testing, add env scripts/docs
- Checkpoint: see `phase-01-debug.md`

---

## 2) Achievements
- Firebase clients (Auth, Firestore, RTDB) implemented: `lib/firebase/client.ts`
- Sentry client initialization added and wired: `lib/observability/sentry.ts`, `app/layout.tsx`
- Testing harness online:
  - Vitest + RTL configured with sample unit test
  - Playwright set up with smoke E2E (boot + DOM ready)
- Scripts and docs updated: `package.json` (`e2e`), `README.md` env section
- Validation: unit tests (8) passing; E2E smoke passing

---

## 3) Challenges
- E2E initially failed (browsers not installed; strict title assertion)
- Vitest imported E2E spec, causing Playwright `test()` conflict
- Minor React `act(...)` warning in existing `useAuth.test.ts`

---

## 4) Root Cause Analysis
- Playwright requires browser binaries; fixed via `pnpm exec playwright install`
- Vitest default glob included `tests/e2e`; resolved by excluding directory in `vitest.config.ts`
- Title assertion brittle due to app title default; replaced with DOM visibility check

---

## 5) Process Evaluation
- Code quality aligns with architecture; minimal, typed singletons; clear separation of concerns
- Tooling effective (pnpm, Vitest, Playwright); quick iteration
- Testing completeness: adequate for foundation; deeper coverage planned in later modules
- Documentation improved via env examples and README updates

---

## 6) Phase Performance Score
- Score: 95%
- Rationale: All objectives met; only minor non-blocking warnings remain

---

## 7) Key Learnings
- Establishing test harness early accelerates iteration and confidence
- Keep E2E assertions resilient (DOM-ready vs brittle titles)
- Centralized env validation/logging speeds diagnosis

---

## 8) Actionable Improvements
- Wrap state-updating test code with `act()` in `useAuth` tests (Module #2)
- Add a Sentry health-check route/button for explicit verification in non-prod
- Add Firebase Emulator config for local-only testing in later modules

---

## 9) Forward Outlook
- Next phase: Module #2 — Authentication (MVP)
  - Implement Firebase Auth (Email/Password + Magic Link)
  - Auth gate for `/c/[canvasId]`
  - Display name fallback logic
- Ensure unit + E2E coverage for login flows; add Playwright multi-context test

---

## 10) Reflection Summary
Module #1 established a solid foundation with environment config, observability, and testing harnesses, enabling rapid and safe development. Early adjustments to E2E and test config resolved initial friction. We’re ready to implement Authentication with high confidence and clear test coverage.
