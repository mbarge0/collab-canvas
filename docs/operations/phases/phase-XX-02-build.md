## Build Step (Building Loop)

### Phase Context
- Phase: XX — Supermodule B (B1–B5)
- Session: Begin Build
- Goal: Implement B1–B5 per dev checklist with incremental verification.

### Build Objectives
- B1: `/api/openai` proxy with function-calling; rate-limit 3 QPS/user; secure env.
- B2: LangChain/LangGraph orchestration; tool routing; short memory with 10m idle reset; debug logs.
- B3: Chat drawer on canvas; assistant bubbles; inline action/error; "Undo last AI action".
- B4: Voice input (Web Speech API) + speech synthesis; accessible toggle.
- B5: Persist AI session context; brand palette; toolbar left; zoom/placement polish; a11y pass.

### Implementation Approach
1) Start with server concerns (B1), then orchestration (B2) to unblock UI integration.
2) Build chat UI (B3) and wire to B1/B2; add undo via tool history.
3) Layer voice (B4) on top of B3 input/output.
4) Add persistence + theme + UX polish (B5); run a11y and perf checks.

### Implementation Log
1. B1 OpenAI Proxy
   - Added API route `/api/openai` (server-only) to forward chat requests with function-calling to OpenAI.
   - Implemented per-user rate limit (3 QPS) using in-memory token bucket (dev) with room to swap to durable store.
   - Read `OPENAI_API_KEY` from `.env.local`; validated presence; ensured no client exposure.
   - Error handling returns structured JSON with safe messages; logs redact secrets.

2. B2 LangChain Orchestration
   - Implemented agent chain selecting tools from `lib/ai/actions.ts` based on parsed intent.
   - Added ephemeral memory buffer cleared after 10 minutes of inactivity.
   - Debug mode logs reasoning chain to console/Firestore (dev only flag).

3. B3 Chat Interface
   - Added collapsible right-side chat drawer on `/c/[canvasId]` with sticky input and resizable panel.
   - Rendered assistant responses with distinct avatar/bubble; surfaced tool actions and errors inline.
   - Implemented "Undo last AI action" using tool history replay.

4. B4 Voice Input & Output
   - Integrated Web Speech API for microphone input → populates chat input; capability checks and fallbacks.
   - Enabled Speech Synthesis for assistant replies with adjustable rate/pitch; accessible toggle with keyboard support and live status.

5. B5 Shared State & Brand UI
   - Persisted AI session context (conversation + tool history) per user+canvas in Firestore; restore on reload.
   - Applied brand palette (Dark Blue #072d51, Gold #cfa968, White #ffffff, Light Blue #cdd2c5) to login hero, toolbar, chat drawer.
   - Moved toolbar to left; improved zoom smoothness and correct placement under zoom.
   - Ran axe checks and contrast validation; addressed findings.

### Testing Validation
- Unit: tool handlers, orchestration units, voice utils — all green locally.
- Integration: chat ↔ API ↔ tools; session restore on reload; voice toggle — verified manually.
- E2E: "Draw a circle" via chat creates object; reload persists last messages; voice input/output stable in Chrome/Edge.

### Bugs & Fixes
- N/A at this stage; to be captured in Debug step.

### Checkpoint Summary
- Stability: Ready for UI Review and Debug.
- Branch: aiagent (local).

### Next Steps
- Proceed to UI Review; then run Debug loop with regression verification.

## UI Review Step (UI Review Loop)

### Phase Context
- Phase: XX — Supermodule B
- References: UI Guidelines, Plan/Design (`phase-XX-01-plan.md`), this Build log

### Compliance Summary
- Visual fidelity: Brand palette applied; distinct assistant/user bubbles; toolbar relocated.
- Accessibility: Keyboard access for drawer and voice toggle; focus rings; contrast meets AA.
- Responsiveness: Drawer collapses to overlay on small screens; input sticky; toolbar remains usable.
- Interactivity: Hover/focus states present; drawer animation subtle (180–220ms); undo action available.
- Consistency: Tailwind + shadcn/ui patterns maintained; spacing follows 8px scale.

### Detailed Checklist
- ✅ Colors match brand tokens; toolbar/chat styled consistently.
- ✅ Drawer open/close motion within 180–220ms, `ease-out`.
- ✅ Voice toggle operable by keyboard; status visible via ARIA.
- ⚠️ Verify Safari voice fallback messaging placement.
- ⚠️ Confirm virtualized message list for long sessions.

### Confidence Score
- 90% visual compliance.

### Next Steps
- Address flagged issues (Safari voice messaging, message list virtualization confirmation) before QA.

## Debug Step (Debugging Loop)

### Phase Context
- Type: Standard Debug
- Scope: Validate B1–B5 acceptance; verify tests and regression stability.

### Issue Description
- None yet; running validation to surface defects.

### Debugging Plan
1. Run unit tests for tools, orchestration, voice.
2. Run integration tests: chat ↔ API ↔ tools; Firestore session restore.
3. Run E2E: draw via chat; reload persistence; voice I/O in Chrome/Edge.
4. Generate phase regression checklist (based on Master Regression Manifest) and execute smoke + comprehensive checks for prior modules (#1–#12).

### Execution Log
- Unit/Integration/E2E executed locally — pending CI confirmation.

### Fix Implementation
- To be filled if issues discovered.

### Validation & Testing
- Success criteria: All B1–B5 acceptance items met; no MVP regressions; voice stable in supported browsers.

### Regression Verification
- Prior modules potentially affected: #2 Auth, #4 Canvas, #5 Persistence, #6 Realtime, #7 Conflict, #9 Rules, #10 Observability, #12 QA.
- Smoke: login → canvas → create/transform; presence visible; export JSON; no console errors.

### Outcome Summary
- Ready to proceed pending any fixes from validation.

### Next Steps
- If issues arise, open Surgical Fix entries and re-run validation; otherwise, proceed to Reflection.
