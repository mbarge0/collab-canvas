## Phase Context
- Phase: Supermodule C — Multiplayer Presence, UI Polish & Deployment (Modules 11–12)
- Date: {{today}}
- Duration: Short sprint (build + debug cycles)
- Objectives: Toolbar UI for Rect/Text; visible presence UI; polished cursor labels; layout polish; deployment/env prep; QA/regression

## Achievements
- Implemented toolbar buttons (+Rect/+Text) using `components/ui/Toolbar.tsx` and integrated into `app/c/[canvasId]/page.tsx`.
- Presence UI: extended `usePresence` to expose `participantsRef` + heartbeat; added avatars in header.
- Cursor labels: switched to Konva `Label`/`Tag` with stable user color and readable white text.
- Layout polish: compact header housing toolbar, presence avatars, and canvas id.
- Documentation: Start, Plan, Build, Debug, Deploy, QA checklist docs created for Supermodule C.
- Tests: Added unit tests for toolbar and presence avatars; updated Konva mocks for Label/Tag.

## Challenges
- Node version (v16) prevented `pnpm test` in this session.
- Deployment smoke test not executed yet (requires Vercel env configuration).

## Root Cause Analysis
- Tests blocked by environment (Node >=18.12 required by pnpm). Resolution path: upgrade Node via fnm/nvm/volta and re-run.
- Deployment pending: awaiting environment variables and Vercel preview setup per deployment guide.

## Process Evaluation
- Code quality: Clear separation of UI primitives, hooks, and canvas components; adherence to existing conventions.
- Architecture alignment: Presence kept within RTDB; shape persistence via Firestore adapter; minimal changes to stage.
- Testing: Unit tests cover toolbar and presence header; further emulator/CI runs needed for rules.
- Documentation: Comprehensive — start/plan/build/debug/deploy/QA articulated.

## Phase Performance Score
- Score: 92%
- Rationale: All core Supermodule C deliverables implemented with tests/docs. Pending tasks: run tests on Node 18+ and perform deployment smoke.

## Key Learnings
- Stable, readable cursor labels benefit from Konva `Label/Tag` rather than raw `Text`.
- Exposing `participantsRef` in presence hook simplifies presence UI without extra listeners.
- Upfront env validation (`config/env.ts`) prevents late-config issues during deploy.

## Actionable Improvements
- Add emulator-backed tests for Firestore/RTDB rules in CI to catch regressions earlier.
- Introduce a tiny presence TTL visualization (dim avatars if `ts` stale >30s) for accuracy.
- Consider adding a floating toolbar mode toggle for small screens if needed.

## Forward Outlook
- Next phase focus: complete deployment to Vercel preview, execute smoke and QA checklist, then finalize production env.
- Re-run unit and rules tests under Node 18+; confirm no regressions.
- Optional: minor UI refinements (hover states, tooltips, header density) post-deploy.

## Reflection Summary
This phase delivered user-visible polish (toolbar, presence avatars, cursor labels) and deployment readiness docs with minimal code surface. The main blockers are environment versioning and pending deployment smoke; once resolved, we’re ready to present a production-ready MVP.
