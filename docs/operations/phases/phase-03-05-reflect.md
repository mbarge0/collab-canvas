# Phase 03 — Reflection (Routing & Shell)

## 1) Phase Context
- **Date:** Oct 13, 2025
- **Duration:** ~1 working block (initial scaffold slice)
- **Objectives:** Scaffold `/c/[canvasId]` route shell, integrate `AuthGuard`, and prepare testing hooks for unit/E2E.
- **Checkpoints:** Build log `phase-03-03-build.md`; Debug report `phase-03-04-debug.md`.

## 2) Achievements
- Implemented shell in `app/c/[canvasId]/page.tsx` with `data-testid` markers for testing.
- Preserved and confirmed `AuthGuard` integration around the canvas route.
- Production build succeeded; unit tests passed (baseline suite); created phase regression checklist.
- Documentation updated: Phase start, plan, build, debug, and this reflection.

## 3) Challenges
- Minor: Client-side guard may cause a brief loader flash — acceptable for MVP; potential future enhancement via middleware.
- Pending scope items: minimal 404 placeholder (T3) and tests (T4/T5) not yet implemented within this slice.

## 4) Root Cause Analysis
- The guard flash is inherent to client-side auth resolution; server-side middleware could mitigate but exceeds current scope.
- Tests are deferred to the next steps by design to keep this slice atomic and verifiable.

## 5) Process Evaluation
- Code quality: clear, typed props (`PageProps`) and test-friendly selectors; aligns with architecture and PRD routing.
- Workflow: followed Phase templates (Start → Plan → Build → Debug → Reflect) improving traceability.
- Testing: build verification and baseline unit test pass; dedicated unit/E2E for shell/redirect planned next.
- Documentation: comprehensive and consistent across the phase artifacts.

## 6) Phase Performance Score
- **Score:** 85%
- **Justification:** Core shell and guard integration delivered cleanly with stable build; tests and 404 handling queued next.

## 7) Key Learnings
- Clear `data-testid` markers accelerate reliable unit/E2E authoring.
- Keeping the guard client-side is fast to ship; middleware can be considered later if SSR/server constraints arise.
- Small, atomic slices (T1 first) keep builds reversible and reduce debugging scope.

## 8) Actionable Improvements
- Implement T3 (404 placeholder) promptly to complete Module 3 acceptance criteria.
- Add T4/T5 tests to lock routing behavior and reduce manual verification overhead.
- Consider adding a minimal pattern check for `canvasId` to reduce invalid route rendering.

## 9) Forward Outlook
- Next phase: Module #4 — Canvas Engine & UI (Konva stage, pan/zoom, selection, transforms).
- Dependencies: This shell and guard serve as the host for Konva; ensure test selectors remain stable.
- Unfinished items: Complete T3–T5 early in the next build loop before integrating Konva.

## 10) Reflection Summary
Phase 03 established a stable, test-ready shell for `/c/[canvasId]` under `AuthGuard`, with a clean build and clear selectors for upcoming tests. The remaining 404 handling and tests are straightforward and will finalize the module before we proceed to the canvas engine work.
