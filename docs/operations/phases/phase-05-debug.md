# Debug Report — Phase 05: Supermodule A1–A5 (Post-Build)

## 1) Scope & Inputs
- Phase: 05 — Pre-AI Reliability, Persistence, Auth & Advanced Features
- References:
  - Dev Checklist: `/docs/foundation/dev_checklist.md` (Supermodule A1–A5)
  - Design Spec: `/docs/operations/phases/phase-05-03-design.md`
  - UI Review: `/docs/operations/phases/phase-05-03-ui-review.md`
  - Regression Manifest: `/docs/operations/regression/00_master_regression_manifest.md`

## 2) Checklist Satisfaction (A1–A5)
- A1 Conflict Resolution 2.0 — ✅
  - Transform session lifecycle in store, TTL locks with Sentry breadcrumbs, LWW writes, safe-cancel, metrics.
- A2 Persistence & Reconnection — ✅
  - Mid‑edit rollback on refresh, `beforeunload` cleanup, connection chip, short offline op queue (UI-side replay).
- A3 Auth & Canvas UI Polish — ✅
  - Two-column login with hero; toolbar bottom-docked; page frame visuals; focus rings; header status.
- A4 Advanced Features Suite — ✅
  - Keyboard nudge/delete; duplicate/delete; grid toggle; snap-to-grid; smart guides; align/distribute; z-index ops; export PNG/SVG; selection PNG; version snapshots/restore with retention; z-index normalization helper.
- A5 AI‑Ready Actions — ✅
  - `lib/ai/actions.ts` with create/move/resize/rotate/align/zIndex/export; UI refactored to call helpers.

## 3) Tests Executed
- Unit/Integration (local):
  - Type checks/lint — ✅ (no new lints in edited files)
  - Store/session actions compile and used by components — ✅
- Manual verification (local build/dev):
  - Create rect/text; select; drag/resize with snap+guides; duplicate; delete — ✅
  - Align left/center/right; top/middle/bottom; distribute H/V — ✅
  - Z-index front/back/step — ✅
  - Export canvas (PNG 1x/2x/4x) and selection PNG — ✅
  - Save version; make edits; restore latest — ✅
  - Mid-edit refresh restores pre-drag state — ✅
  - Offline toggle (dev) queues updates then flushes — ✅ basic
  - Login page renders two-column layout; focusable controls; modes switch — ✅

## 4) Regression Checklist (derived from Master Manifest)
- Phase 01 Env/Build: `pnpm build`/typecheck clean — ✅
- Phase 02 Auth: login/magic link (manual dev), session restore, auth gate — ✅ basic
- Phase 03 Routing: `/c/[canvasId]` loads; invalid guarded — ✅
- Phase 04 Canvas base: pan/zoom; selection; transforms at 60 FPS — ✅ subjective OK
- Phase 05 UI: toolbar visible/usable; responsive behavior acceptable — ✅

## 5) Results Summary
- ✅ Working
  - Transform sessions + locks + arbitration
  - Persistence/reconnect UX (chip, rollback, op queue)
  - Toolbar actions (dup/delete/align/distribute/z-index/export)
  - Grid + snap + smart guides
  - Version history (save/restore with retention)
  - AI-ready action abstractions; UI calling helpers
  - Login two-column UI with focus styles

- ⚠️ Issues
  - [Low] Icon-only toolbar buttons rely on `title`; add `aria-label` for SRs.
  - [Low] SVG export text baseline may render slightly differently vs canvas.
  - [Low] Extremely small mobile heights could overflow toolbar; consider overflow scroll/compact menu.

- 🧩 Fixes Applied (this phase)
  - Added session lifecycle and TTL with Sentry breadcrumbs.
  - Implemented rollback via localStorage snapshot; cleared on commit.
  - Offline op queue with reconnection flush.
  - Added bottom toolbar, grid overlay, snap/guides, alignment, z-index, exports, versions.
  - Abstracted AI actions and refactored UI to call them.

## 6) Stability Confidence
- **Rating:** High
- Rationale: Features operate as designed, no lints, interactions remain smooth, and prior-phase flows intact in manual smoke.

## 7) Readiness
- Ready to proceed to Reflection Phase.

## 8) Regression Verification Notes
- Source: `/docs/operations/regression/00_master_regression_manifest.md`
- Quick smoke on prior phases completed with no blocking regressions.
