# Phase-XX — Final Rubric Verification Review

## Verification Context
- Date: 2025-10-17
- Verification Type: Final Rubric Review
- Build Reference: Local dev build (Next.js) on branch `presubmittuneup`
- Artifacts Reviewed:
  - PRD/Architecture: `/docs/foundation/prd.md`, `/docs/foundation/architecture.md`
  - Dev Checklist: `/docs/foundation/dev_checklist.md`
  - Phase Plans/Build/Debug: `phase-13-01-plan.md`, `phase-13-02-build.md`, `phase-XX-02-build.md`
  - README: `/README.md`
  - Demo Video: pending link (to be attached)

## Rubric Summary
- Source Rubric: `/docs/requirements/requirements2.md`
- Categories Assessed:
  - Functionality; Performance & Responsiveness; Persistence & Data Handling; Scalability
  - Accessibility & Usability; Visual Design & Branding; AI Agent Functionality
  - Documentation & Deliverables (Dev Log, Demo Video, README)

## Functional Verification
- Tests Executed:
  - Login flow (magic link + email/password)
  - Canvas: create/move/resize/rotate rectangle/text; multi-select; pan/zoom
  - Realtime presence and labeled cursors (two-browser smoke)
  - Toolbar left-docked; grouped alignment/distribute; export JSON
  - AI: prompt to create/move shape; tool calls reflected on canvas
- Evidence:
  - Console logs show session restore and tool actions
  - E2E notes: smoke scenarios pass locally per `phase-XX-02-build.md`
- Result: ✅ Pass

## Performance & Stability
- Targets: 60 FPS interactions; <100 ms object sync; <50 ms cursor
- Observations:
  - Smooth drag/zoom on typical scenes; Konva rAF + throttles in place
  - Two-user smoke shows responsive cursors
  - Heavy scenes (500+ shapes) not exhaustively profiled in this pass
- Evidence: Manual profiling notes in `phase-13-02-build.md`
- Result: ⚠️ Needs Review (add quantified metrics and stress capture for 500+ shapes)

## Persistence & Scalability
- Checks: reload restores state; reconnects after brief network drop; JSON export
- Observations: State persists; presence recovers; export works
- Evidence: Build/Debug logs indicate restore and presence behavior; JSON export verified
- Result: ✅ Pass

## Accessibility & UI/UX
- Checks: axe scan (no critical); keyboard traversal; focus rings; contrast AA
- Observations: Brand tokens applied; left hero image on `/login` visible md+; form centered; tooltips/shortcuts
- Evidence: `app/login/page.tsx` surgical fix; axe notes in build log
- Result: ✅ Pass

## Visual Design & Branding
- Checks: Brand palette (Dark Blue #072d51, Gold #cfa968, White #ffffff, Light Blue #cdd2c5) across login, toolbar, chat
- Observations: Theming consistent; canvas background neutral; typography updated
- Evidence: Tokens applied in UI; screenshots pending
- Result: ✅ Pass

## AI Agent Functionality
- Checks: Create/move/resize/rotate/text; alignment/layout via agent; latency <2s typical
- Observations: Tool calls mapped via `lib/ai/actions.ts` and `lib/ai/bridge.ts`; responses visible in chat
- Evidence: AI smoke E2E notes; local runs OK
- Result: ✅ Pass (baseline); recommend capturing a short demo clip of agent actions

## Documentation & Deliverables
- Dev Log: present across phase docs and iteration logs — summarize in a single index for submission
- README: setup, env, run instructions present
- Demo Video: link pending (must show 2-user realtime + AI commands + features)
- Evidence: repo docs present; need video URL
- Result: ⚠️ Needs Review (attach final video link; add brief consolidated dev log summary)

## Rubric Verification Table
| Category | Status | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| Functionality | ✅ Pass | Core flows + AI tool calls operational |
| Performance | ⚠️ Needs Review | Add quantified metrics; 500+ shapes capture |
| Persistence | ✅ Pass | Reload restore; export works |
| Scalability | ⚠️ Needs Review | Validate 5–8 users; large-scene FPS |
| Accessibility & UX | ✅ Pass | Axe clean; keyboard/focus verified |
| Visual & Branding | ✅ Pass | Consistent palette and UI polish |
| AI Agent | ✅ Pass | Commands execute; responses shown |
| Documentation & Deliverables | ⚠️ Needs Review | Pending demo video link; dev log index |

## Outcome Summary
- Overall Status: Needs Review
- Strengths: Solid functionality and UX; AI integration works; brand/theming cohesive; accessibility checks passing
- Gaps: Quantitative performance evidence under load; attach demo video; consolidate dev log summary

## Next Steps
1. Capture performance evidence: 500+ shapes FPS, two-user latency metrics; add to build log
2. Record and link demo video demonstrating required scenarios
3. Add a short consolidated dev log summary (tools used, prompts, learnings) to README and/or `/docs/operations/`
4. Re-run this checklist and mark Performance/Scalability/Deliverables as ✅
