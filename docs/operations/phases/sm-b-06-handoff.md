# Context Summary — Supermodule B: Product & Stability Layer (Modules 8–10)

## 1) Phase Summary
- **Phase Name:** Supermodule B — Product & Stability Layer (Modules 8–10)
- **Date Completed:** Oct 14, 2025
- **Duration:** ~1 day
- **Phase Outcome:** Text creation/editing with persistence added alongside rectangles; security rules authored (Firestore + RTDB) with emulator config; performance/observability hardening (rAF batching, hidden-tab unsubscribes, optional FPS meter) and seed script for 100+ objects; unit tests pass; rules/E2E scaffolds added and skipped pending emulator deps.
- **Stability Rating:** High

## 2) Core Deliverables
- Canvas & UI:
  - `components/canvas/ShapeLayer.tsx` — render rect + text with selection styling
  - `components/canvas/CanvasStage.tsx` — keyboard: Arrow/Del/Enter, 'T' to create text; FPS overlay
  - `components/canvas/TextEditModal.tsx` — inline text editing modal
  - `components/canvas/TransformHandles.tsx` — persisted delete integration via stage
- Store & Hooks:
  - `lib/store/canvas-store.ts` — discriminated node types (`rect` | `text`), styling fields
  - `lib/hooks/useShapesSync.ts` — rAF-batched snapshots; visibility pause/resume
  - `lib/hooks/usePresence.ts` — ~20 Hz cursor throttle; visibility unsubscribe
  - `lib/hooks/useShapeWriter.ts` — debounced writes and final commits
- Data & Rules:
  - `lib/data/firestore-adapter.ts` — CRUD + listeners (used by stage/writer)
  - `firestore.rules`, `database.rules.json` — Module 9 rules
  - `firebase.json` — emulator ports and rules mapping
- Observability & Perf:
  - `lib/observability/sentry.ts` + `app/layout.tsx` init
  - `scripts/seedCanvas.ts` — seeds 100+ shapes for perf checks
- Docs:
  - `sm-b-01-start.md`, `sm-b-02-plan.md`, `sm-b-03-build.md`, `phase-0B-04-debug.md`, `phase-0B-05-reflect.md`, `sm-b-06-handoff.md`

## 3) Testing Status
- Unit: PASS — canvas store, stage render, text/rect rendering, writer debounce
- Rules: Skipped placeholders — `tests/unit/data/{firestore,rtdb}.rules.test.ts` (pending emulator deps)
- E2E: Skipped scaffold — `tests/e2e/canvas/text-and-rules.spec.ts`
- Manual: Text create/edit/delete persists; with 100+ shapes and FPS overlay, interactions ~60 FPS; hidden-tab pause/resume verified.

## 4) Risks and Limitations
- Emulator-based rules tests not yet running (deps missing). Risk: rules coverage unvalidated automatically.
- zIndex refinement for new shapes could be improved for deterministic ordering under heavy edits.

## 5) Next Objectives
- Add `@firebase/rules-unit-testing` and enable emulator-backed rules tests locally and in CI.
- Unskip E2E for text + rules; run two-context auth flow.
- Optional: JSON export/import helpers for canvas data; zIndex strategy refinement.
- Prepare Deployment & QA (Supermodule C): preview build, env validation, smoke E2E.

## 6) References
- Dev Checklist Modules 8–10: `/docs/foundation/dev_checklist.md`
- Phase Docs: `sm-b-01-start.md`, `sm-b-02-plan.md`, `sm-b-03-build.md`, `phase-0B-04-debug.md`, `phase-0B-05-reflect.md`
- Regression Checklist: `/docs/operations/regression/phase-0B-regression-checklist.md`
- Emulator Config: `/firebase.json`; Rules: `/firestore.rules`, `/database.rules.json`
- Branch: `product-stability-layer`

## 7) Summary Statement
Supermodule B delivered the product layer on top of the realtime backbone: text tooling, security policies, and performance safeguards landed with unit-tested stability. With emulator-driven rules tests and E2E to enable next, the system is ready to enter Deployment & QA with high confidence.
