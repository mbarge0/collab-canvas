# Weekly Report – Week [X] — [Project Name]  
_Version 1.1 — Gauntlet Mode (Oct 2025)_  

Captures the weekly reflection cycle for the Gauntlet program.  
Use this to consolidate outcomes, lessons, and forward planning after each phase or sprint.  
Cursor and Copilot can assist in generating this automatically using the Reflection Loop Template.  


## 1. Overview
- **Week Focus:**  
  *(Brief summary of the main development goal or learning focus this week.)*  
- **Core Deliverables:**  
  *(List the specific outcomes shipped — features, fixes, tests, or documentation.)*  
- **AI Features Implemented:**  
  *(Note any AI-specific improvements or experiments added to the system.)*  

> Prompt reference: `/prompts/system/05_reflection_loop.md`  
> Example use: “Summarize this week’s achievements and focus areas in Weekly Report format.”  


## 2. Wins
List what worked well, technically or strategically.  
Focus on breakthroughs, clarity gained, and improved workflows.  

- [ ]  
- [ ]  

*Cursor Tip:* Ask, “What went especially right this week, and why?”  
to generate this section automatically.


## 3. Challenges
List blockers, friction points, or unexpected issues.  
Include both technical (code-level) and workflow (process-level) challenges.  

- [ ]  
- [ ]  

*Cursor Tip:* Use `/prompts/literal/04_debugging/diagnose_issue.md`  
to identify root causes before summarizing them here.


## 4. Lessons Learned
Summarize insights gained from wins and challenges.  
What should change in prompts, workflows, or coding practices next week?

*Reference:* Cursor Context Management Playbook — Reflection Loop Section.  
This connects lessons directly to adjustments in your literal prompt usage or templates.


## 5. Next Steps
Translate lessons into specific, actionable next moves.  
Include technical, workflow, or mindset shifts.

> Tip: For each “Next Step,” link to a literal prompt or template that will help execute it next week.  
> Example: `/prompts/literal/02_planning/phase_kickoff.md`


## 6. Content Notes
Track any public updates, posts, or communication derived from this week’s progress.  

- **Clips or Posts to Share:**  
  *(List titles, links, or ideas for social updates.)*  
- **Takeaway Quote:**  
  *(One short, memorable summary line or insight from this week.)*  

> Optional: Sync with `/docs/social/social_status_tracker.md`  
  to track posting readiness or engagement data.  


## 7. Meta Reflection (Optional)
For deeper learning tracking — optional but valuable.  

- **Prompt Quality Rating (1–10):**  
  How effective were your Cursor prompts this week?  
- **Workflow Clarity (1–10):**  
  How smooth was your daily flow between Cursor, Copilot, and manual coding?  
- **Testing Confidence (1–10):**  
  How confident are you that your current testing coverage protects the system?  

*(Use these self-ratings to drive improvements in prompt refinement and system automation.)*

**Summary:**  
`weekly_report.md` = reflection checkpoint.  
It closes the loop between coding, testing, and self-improvement.  
In Gauntlet Mode, it becomes both a personal retrospective and a live training record.  
Cursor can auto-fill, but *you* provide the nuance.
