- Type: Comprehensive Rubric QA
- Build Reference: Local dev build (Next.js) on branch `presubmittuneup`
- Rubric Source: `/docs/requirements/requirements2.md`
- Reviewer: Automated + Human Assisted (Cursor QA)

## Rubric Summary
| Category | Status | Evidence | Notes |
|-----------|---------|-----------|-------|
| Functionality | âœ… Pass | `verification/verification.md` + build logs | Core flows + AI tool calls operational |
| Performance | âœ… Pass | `verification/verification.md` (metrics) | 59 FPS avg drag; 14 ms zoom latency |
| Persistence | âœ… Pass | Export/reload checks | State restores; export JSON works |
| Accessibility | âœ… Pass | Axe/manual checks | No critical violations; keyboard/focus OK |
| Visual/Branding | âœ… Pass | `verification/evidence/login_page.png` | Brand palette applied; hero visible (md+) |
| Scalability | âœ… Pass | `verification/verification.md` (multiuser) | 5-user smoke: <80 ms sync delay |
| Deliverables | âœ… Pass | README + video link | Demo video + dev-log summary present |

## Automated / Code Context Checks
- Endpoints: `/app/api/openai` present and healthy
- Client Integration: `lib/ai/actions.ts`, `lib/ai/bridge.ts` drive tool actions with immediate UI
- UI Components: Left-docked toolbar; Chat drawer; Login hero via `next/image`
- Data & Sync: Firestore/RTDB adapters and hooks wired; debounced writes; presence streaming

## Quantitative Performance Metrics
