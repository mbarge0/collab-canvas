## 6. Technical Constraints

### 6.1 Technology Stack
- **Frontend Framework**: Next.js 14+ with App Router
- **Styling**: TailwindCSS
- **Language**: TypeScript (strict mode)
- **Backend/Database**: Supabase (PostgreSQL, Auth, Realtime)
- **Deployment**: Vercel
- **Testing**: Vitest, Sutest, Playwright

### 6.2 Architecture Constraints
- **App Router Structure**: Use Next.js 14 App Router conventions
- **API Routes**: RESTful design in `app/api/`
- **Real-Time**: Supabase Realtime subscriptions (WebSocket-based)
- **State Management**: React hooks + Supabase client
- **Type Safety**: Strict TypeScript, no `any` types

### 6.3 Database Schema (Supabase PostgreSQL)

```sql
-- Users Table
CREATE TABLE users (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
  email TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL,
  display_name TEXT NOT NULL,
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Channels Table
CREATE TABLE channels (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
  name TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL,
  description TEXT,
  is_private BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
  created_by UUID REFERENCES users(id),
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Messages Table
CREATE TABLE messages (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
  channel_id UUID REFERENCES channels(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  user_id UUID REFERENCES users(id),
  content TEXT NOT NULL,
  message_type TEXT DEFAULT 'user', -- 'user' or 'ai_summary' (future)
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW(),
  
  INDEX idx_messages_channel_created (channel_id, created_at DESC),
  INDEX idx_messages_user (user_id)
);

-- Channel Members Table (for private channel access)
CREATE TABLE channel_members (
  channel_id UUID REFERENCES channels(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  user_id UUID REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  joined_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW(),
  
  PRIMARY KEY (channel_id, user_id)
);

-- User Presence Table
CREATE TABLE user_presence (
  user_id UUID PRIMARY KEY REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  online BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
  last_seen TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

**Indexes for Performance:**
- `messages.channel_id + created_at` (DESC) for fast recent message queries
- `messages.user_id` for user-specific queries
- Composite primary key on `channel_members` for efficient membership checks

### 6.4 Real-Time Subscriptions
**Supabase Realtime Channels:**
- `messages` table: Listen for INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE
- `user_presence` table: Listen for UPDATE (online/offline)
- `channel_members` table: Listen for INSERT (new members)

**Performance Optimization:**
- Subscribe only to active channel messages
- Unsubscribe when switching channels
- Batch presence updates (debounce 5 seconds)

### 6.5 Security Constraints
- **Row-Level Security (RLS)**: Enable on all Supabase tables
  - Users can only read messages from channels they're members of
  - Users can only edit/delete their own messages
  - Private channels only visible to members
- **Environment Variables**: Never commit `.env` files
- **API Keys**: Use environment variables, validate on server
- **Input Validation**: Sanitize all user inputs, prevent XSS/SQL injection

### 6.6 Performance Constraints
- **Message Latency**: <200ms target (measure with Playwright)
- **Concurrent Users**: Support 10+ without degradation
- **Database Queries**: N+1 prevention, use joins/includes
- **Real-Time Connections**: Limit to 1-2 subscriptions per client

---

## 7. Stretch Goals

### 7.1 AI Chat Summarization (Future - Architecture Planned)
**Status**: Planned in architecture, not built initially

**Feature Description:**
- User types `/summarize` command in message input
- System fetches last 10-20 messages from current channel
- Sends messages to OpenAI API for summarization
- Posts AI-generated summary as special message in channel

**Architecture Planning:**
- [x] Reserve command pattern detection (messages starting with `/`)
- [x] `message_type` field in `messages` table ('user' vs 'ai_summary')
- [x] API route structure: `POST /api/ai/summarize`
- [x] Separate UI panel for AI summaries (not inline with chat)

**Implementation Approach** (when ready):
1. Detect `/summarize` in message input
2. Query last N messages from current channel
3. Send to `POST /api/ai/summarize` with OpenAI API call
4. Store summary as `message_type: 'ai_summary'`
5. Display in separate "AI Summaries" panel

**Prerequisites Before Building:**
- [ ] Core chat app fully deployed and tested
- [ ] No critical bugs or performance issues
- [ ] OpenAI API key configured

## 8. Out of Scope

**Explicitly excluded from this project:**

### User Features
- ❌ **Private Direct Messages (DMs)**: Only channel-based chat
- ❌ **User Profiles Beyond Name**: No avatars, bios, or custom settings
- ❌ **Message Search**: No full-text search functionality
- ❌ **Reactions/Emoji Support**: Text-only messages
- ❌ **File Uploads/Media Sharing**: No attachments or images
- ❌ **Typing Indicators**: No "User is typing..." feature

### Technical Features
- ❌ **Per-Channel Presence**: Only global online/offline status
- ❌ **Message Edit History**: Only "(edited)" indicator, no version tracking
- ❌ **Channel Deletion**: Channels are permanent once created
- ❌ **Message Threading**: No reply chains or threads
- ❌ **Push Notifications**: No email/SMS alerts

### Infrastructure
- ❌ **Rate Limiting**: No message send throttling
- ❌ **Network Failure Handling**: Basic error states only
- ❌ **Auth Failure Recovery**: No magic link retry logic
- ❌ **Advanced Error Recovery**: Basic error boundaries only

**Rationale**: These features add complexity without serving the core portfolio demonstration goal. They can be added post-dry-run if desired.

### 10.2 Fallback Plans

**If Behind Schedule After Day 1 Morning:**
- **Issue**: Auth not working
- **Fallback**: Use simplified email/password auth instead of magic link
- **Time Saved**: ~1 hour

**If Behind Schedule After Day 1 Afternoon:**
- **Issue**: Real-time not working
- **Fallback**: Use polling (5-second interval) instead of Supabase Realtime
- **Trade-off**: Higher latency but functional
- **Time Saved**: ~2 hours

**If Behind Schedule Day 2 Morning:**
- **Issue**: Private channels complex
- **Fallback**: Defer private channels, implement only public channels
- **Requirement Status**: Still meets core portfolio goal
- **Time Saved**: ~2 hours

**If Behind Schedule Day 2 Afternoon:**
- **Issue**: Not enough time for full testing
- **Fallback Priority Order**:
  1. E2E tests for critical path (auth → message → deploy) - MUST HAVE
  2. Manual QA checklist - MUST HAVE
  3. Integration tests - NICE TO HAVE
  4. Unit tests - NICE TO HAVE

**Critical Path (Cannot Be Cut):**
- ✅ Authentication working (magic link or email/password)
- ✅ Real-time messaging (even if polling fallback)
- ✅ Basic UI functional
- ✅ Deployed to Vercel with live URL
- ✅ README with setup instructions

**Flexible Elements (Can Be Simplified):**
- Private channels → Public only
- Message editing → View only
- Presence → Static user list
- Comprehensive tests → Critical path only
